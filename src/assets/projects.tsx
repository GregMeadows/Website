          have done, but ended up as more as a project itself. However I have
          greatly enjoyed working with these new technologies, and will continue
          to add the the site as I learn.

          This was a Java based desktop application, developed for my university
          dissertation. It was designed to analyse tweets (before they are
          tweeted) and predict the sentiment response that they would receive.

          This type of software could have multiple applications, such as within
          business enterprises, or public figures, where they wish to see the
          impact of the tweet before it is published. Tweets can have a broad
          impact on businesses in current society, affecting sales and stock
          prices, such a tool would aid in mitigating accidental poor publicity.

          This project involved using several different techniques and

          awarded a distinction.

          We were tasked to create a virtual rehabilitation environment, for
          patients with neurological conditions based at the Danesbury
          Neurological Centre, Welwyn. As a result, many UX considerations had
          to be made to allow for a wide range of accessibility issues, such as
          the use of a simple layout, and colour-coded pages. The final design
          can be seen to the right.

          frontend functionality, using JSON to communicate between the two. The
